# RingVisualizer
 Simple music visualizer using Minim.  Two original songs included, free-of-charge.  Add your own songs to the music folder as long as they are in .wav format!  Standalone applications included.
 
 Instructions for use: If you just want to use the program itself, download the release to the right, unzip, and use the application.windows64 folder.  Inside is the executable and a data folder with a music folder inside.  Place your music (in .wav format) into the music folder and it will be queued up and shuffled when you run the program.  You can even remove my songs from it, although this is not recommended since they're pretty good.
 
 Once you open the program, the music will be shuffled.  You can fast forward by left-clicking or go back to the last song by right-clicking.  
 
 Enjoy!
